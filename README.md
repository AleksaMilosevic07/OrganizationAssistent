# OrganizationAssistent
Organization Assistent is a simple and light weight program I made to help you organize your files from one address to the other! It is not perfect and will probably be updated in the future to include more popular file extensions.
# How does it work?
Apon launching you will be met with 5 different options in total, those are: \n
0. Exit
1. Setup
2. Organization folder path
3. Unorganized folder path
4. Start

# Setup function 
Setup function is for your first time launching the code. It will create few different folders made for storing different types of files.
These include:
    Archives - .zip, .rar, .tar.gz, .7z, .iso 
    Audio - .mp3, .wav, .flac, .aac, .ogg 
    Videos - .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .wmv
    CodeFiles - .cpp, .c, java, .py, .html, .css, .lua, .js
    Photos - .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .svg
    Texts - .txt, .docx, .pdf, .rtf, .csv
    Videos - .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .wmv

Organization Assistant will create these folders for you after you give the address where you want these folders created. It will ask for the address of your Organization folder (Adress where you want to have the folders mentioned above) And unorganized folder (Folder where your unorganized stuff is)

After you give these 2 addresses you are ready to use Organization Assistant.

# Organization folder path
This function will simply ask you for the address of the folder that is supposed to contain all the folder neccessary. You should run this if you have already used Organization Assistant before and you have all folders ready

# Unorganized folder path
This function will simply ask you for the address of the folder that is supposed to contain all the unorganized files you want moved. You should run this if you have already used Organization Assistant before and you have all folders ready

# Start
After you have set both the organization folder path and the unorganized folder path, you are ready to actually start moving the files from your messy folder, to the organized folder. Pretty straight forward


# Planned features

    - Organization folder goes trough all your sub folders in messy folder as well, would allow you to simply select your C drive for example and have all the supported files transfered where you want them to
    - Organization assistant remembers your organization folder path and your unorganized folder path after closing and reopening.
    - Improving code, reducing repetition
    - More file types and more file categories

# Copyright
You are free to copy, share and publish copies of this project however you like, but I would really appriciate if you credit my original code where you use it, means a lot.
